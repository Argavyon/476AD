## NEWS  
  
### EUROPA OCCIDENS  
  
* An emissary of the Visigoths arrives in Britannia, meeting with various Saxon, Jutish, and Anglii chieftains.  
  
* Syagrius, the magister militum for Roman Gaul, announces that Gaul will send food stuffs and agricultural goods to Odoacer - the new miliary leader governing Italia. However as caravans cross into the Kingdom of the Visigoths they are met by Gothic patrols who announce they must turn back, having "not paid the relevant tax". They insist their path will lead them across Burgundian lands before long, but the Visigoths are unrelenting and the caravans turn back.  
  
* Perhaps compelled by events on the roads south, the Romans in Gaul announce major improvement works to the highways across Roman Gaul, as well as to road posts.  
  
* Works are also announced to modernise major cities into grids, with stone buildings and ample space in the cities for future planning. Some deride the plan as needlessly ambitious in light of the pressures on this outpost of empire, and likely to take many years. Works begin in Lutetia and Durocortorum nevertheless.  
  
* Alongside plans to rebuild the cities, Syagrius announces that the population of Roman Gaul must group together more. The government compels peasants to live in groupings of at least 5-6 families, and promises prosperity in the cities to all others. Villages swell in size, but few take up the offer of the cities for now.  
  
* The Frankish tribes recruit 1 heavy infantry unit.  
  
* Euric, King of the Visigoths, promulgates the new Codex Euricianus, a meld of Roman and Gothic law reflecting the strong Roman influence in his kingdom.  
  
* The Visigoths also raise an additional 1 light cavalry and 1 heavy infantry.  
  
* King Chilperic of the Burgundians announces he too will recruit more troops, adding 1 light infantry and 1 unit of archers to his forces.  
  
* The Burgundians also expand their minor industries in the cities they hold, successfully expanding them.  
  
* The Roman Senate sends the imperial regalia of the Western Roman Empire to Zeno, the Eastern Emperor. They call on him to take on sole emperorship, and to recognise the rule of Odoacer in Italia.  
  
* In stark contrast, King Euric of the Visigoths sends messengers to Julius Nepos in Dalmatia, hailing him as the legitimate Western Emperor and congratulating him on the removal of Romulus Augustulus.  
  
* In his role as military leader in Italia, Odoacer solidifies his position carefully. Land is distributed to key allies and loyal followers as thanks for their role in deposing Orestes and his son Romulus, and other tribute, donations, and gifts are made to the rank and file, enshrining his popularity with the army. Combined with his popularity with the Roman Senate, Odoacer's position in society grows stronger.  
  
* A small Alemanni raiding party crosses over into Italia, perhaps seeking to take advantage of the power vacuum there. They raid a number of towns north of the Alps, carrying off captives and gold.  
  
* Two heavy infantry units are raised in Italia by the army of Odoacer.  
  
* From the imperial court in Dalmatia, celebrations mark the fall of another usurper. Comparisons are quickly made between Emperor Julius Nepos, and Emperor Zeno - who has recently reclaimed his own throne in Constantinople.  
  
* Nepos quickly announces the expansion of his military, raising 2 light cavalry and 1 heavy cavalry.  
  
* Further he undertakes some investments in the local economy, boosting his own incomes.  
  
### EUROPA ORIENS  
  
* Having somehow obtained clemency from Emperor Zeno following his reclaiming of Constantinople, Theodoric Strabo announces that the Thracian Goths will launch an expedition in the name of the Empire into Dacia in the north.  
  
* Perhaps embarrassed by his kinsman's extremely friendly envoy, Theodoric the Amal accepts the offer to participate in the raid and sends 1 LC to join the Thracian Gothic force of 1 LC and 1 LI on the raid against the Sklaveni tribes.  
  
* Soon after the Goths are assembled, a Roman force of 1 LC and 1 HC under Flavius Illus arrives. Rather than a fight, they bring supplies for the Goths as they venture northwards.  
  
* However, the Romans appear uncertain - it is not clear if the entire Thracian Goths as a whole will move out. Upon seeing only part of the army begin to depart and the rest remain encamped, Flavius Illus gives the order follow the small force until it crosses the Danube River, before returning to Marcianopolis.  
  
* Under the banners of the Roman Empire, the small Gothic army ravages many villages of the slavic tribes. Though few riches can be found, slaves are taken and sold promptly in the markets of Constantinople.  
  
* Back in Thracia, Theodoric Strabo orders that additional forces (1 HA and 1 LC) be raised for future raids.  
  
* Theodoric the Amal, king of the Ostrogoths in Moesia, petitions Emperor Zeno in Constantinople for the establishment of further trade and diplomatic ties - citing his connections with the Empire, his time in his youth as a ward of Emperor Leo I, and his help in the past few years defending the borders of the Empire from raiders.  
  
* In Constantinople, Zeno raises his brother Flavius Longinus in the imperial hierarchy, enshrining him as a leader. However his influence and ability are severely hampered by Longinus' position as a unwilling "guest" of Flavius Illus.  
  
### ASIA  
  
* Rebuilding the Roman fleet after its defeats to the Vandals, three new fleets are constructed in the Sea of Marmara. Separately, 2 HI and 2 LI are raised by Constantinople, and quickly allotted to postings with the Comitatus Praesentales in Nicea and Nicomedia.  
  
* Building on a growing number of years at peace, the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanid Empire announce a join project of infrastructure and road building, connecting Roman Syria with Mesopotamia and the Gulf. The project reaps significant benefits for both, and the prospect of future gains remains significant.  
  
* Nevertheless, in the Sassanid capital, Ctesiphon, new troops are raised in great numbers. 1 HC, 1 camel cavalry, 1 unit of elephants, and 1 HI are all added to the forces there.  
  
* Moreover, the Shah himself takes command of the heavy cavalry there and personally drills them in new unit tactics. Rebuilding the steel fist of Persia, he names this new unit as the elite of the cataphracts - heavily armoured shock cavalry.  
  
* Work at Ctesiphon continues as the defences of the city are strengthened with stone as well as men. A new project is begun to raise new and formidable walls around the city, and although still needing more time and funds, planners estimate they will make the capital "unassailable".  
  
* Tensions continue to mount between the Kingdom of Kartli and Varsken, an Iranian prince and proponent of Sassanid influence in the Caucasus (particularly in Armenia), following Varsken's conversion to Zoroastrianism and execution of his Christian wife for refusing to do the same.  
  
* The White Huns expand their control further still over the city states of the Tarim Basin.  
  
* In Merv, close to the border with the White Huns, Sassanid general Hazarwuxt launches a project to fortify Merv. The city becomes a bastion of Sassanid power in the area.  
  
* In the Persian Gulf, a new Sassanid fleet is put to see. Balash is named commander of the Sassanid Fleet, and soon departs with at the head of an exploration mission out into the Indian Ocean.  
  
* The Persian expedition ventures along the Gupta coasts in the northwest, before turning south and connecting with the Vakataka Empire and the Kandambas in India, building ties and exploring trade opportunities the whole way.  
  
* A second expedition also sets out from Persia, heading down around Arabia. Surveying along the Omani coast, they venture as far as Socotra, an island grouping off the Horn of Africa.  
  
* Expanding their presence throughout this crucial intersection of the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean, the Persians establish a small colony on the island.  
  
### AFRICA  
  
* Having turned his eye to governing instead of war in his old age, King Gaiseric of the Vandals orders that an "Academy of Carthage" be established, focusing on continuing the philosophical and theologic traditions of North Africa.  
  
* The burgeoning school is quickly compared to the academy of Athens, though observers note the focus on Areian Christianity and the notion of it being a culmination of Greek, Christian, and Germanic traditions.  
  
* There is some resistance to this latest development from the (already heavily persecuted) Nicene Christians living in Vandalic lands. Some bishops lodge a complaint with the King, calling for freedom to establish their own schools. Small protests in streets are quickly suppressed.  
  
* The Vandals also undertake a census of their kingdom, the first in many years.  
  
* Capitalising on their strength in the Mediterranean Sea, the Vandals put 2 new fleets to sea - currently they sit as the undisputed power on the seas.  
  
* Perhaps signally a simultaneous turn inwards towards the rest of Africa, King Gaiseric also orders that 2 units of camel cavalry be raised.  
  
* A new fort is also established by Huneric, son of King Gaiseric, in the east of Vandal territories.  
  
* Unrest captures the city of Alexandria, as pagans in the city riot in response to rumours that the local bishops are intending to demolish their temples. A hub of non-Christian sentiment in the Roman Empire, the mobs burn down a local Nicene Christian church and throw three priests into the harbour.
