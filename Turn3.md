## NEWS
 
### EUROPA OCCIDENS
 
* Suevic royal authority falters in the face of internal divisions, as King Hermeneric struggles to soothe familial divides. Factions spring up around key contenders for power, with some demanding a quick and victorious war to unify the kingdom. Amongst them, only one cousin - Agiulf - sends a missive to the Visigoths asking for help to keep the peace.
 
* The Visigoths find themselves facing their own difficulties on multiple fronts, however. As King Euric reasserts his authority amongst his Hispanic vassals, nobles, and chieftains, trouble brews in Baetica.
 
* Heavily Romanised, the south of Hispania seethes with unrest at the rumours of both internal divisions at Euric's court, and at notions that he seeks a reconciliation with the Empire.
 
* A bold member of a patrician family, known in local circles in Colonia Patricia as Jovinianus, declares himself "comes Hispaniarum" and raises a small force of locals across the surrounding area.
 
* Jovianius sends missives to Euric, Odoacer, Nepos, Zeno, and Syagrius - calling for recognition and support.
 
* The Visigoths also lay down 2 fleets of ships at ports elsewhere in Hispania.
 
* In Burgundy, a flurry of investigators descend to look into the demise of Gundobad, the current King's nephew. The Burgundian's own investigation points to it clearly being an outside force, while Odoacer's envoy (escorted by 1 LC) fingers "a Greek speaker" based on the testimony of some servants.
 
* Chilperic's remaining nephews, Godomar, Godegisel, and Chilperic the Younger, seem less perturbed at the death of their famous (or infamous) brother. Jostling for supremacy, the would-be Chilperic II becomes the favourite of many.
 
* Meanwhile Roman Gaul sends 1 LI and 1 A to patrol the Roman and Burgundian border with the Visigothic Kingdom.
 
* Some tribes of the Franks, in particular under Childeric, accept an offer to migrate further into Roman territory. They settle rich farm lands along the south bank of the Seine, just beyond Lutetia. They quickly put the fertile soils to work and are soon adding to the local economy.
 
* Syagrius sends the captured Alemanni chief back to his people, accompanied by a grand guard of 1 HA, 1 HC, and 1 LC. Extracting a promise from the chieftain to participate in an expanded protectorate, he quickly returns to his people.
 
* Further south, near the border with Italy, rumours reach the border towns of a confederation forming amongst some local chieftains and kings to resist Roman incursions. They issue a demand for the release of Alemanni prisoners.
 
* Addressing Italia's own concerns about the Alemanni, fortifications are constructed by Thela, son of Odoacer, in the Alpine passes to the north, seeking to funnel raiders and control their flow.
 
* A similar approach is taken along the western Alps separating Italia from the Visigothic Kingdom. Although they leave southern Gaullish territories beyond their protection, these major forts form considerable strongpoints.
 
* 2 HI, 1 HC, and 1 LC are sent to man the new West Alpine forts.
 
* Following an announcement by the Kings of the Vandals, Visigoths, and Moesian Ostrogoths against Odoacer being named rex Italiae by Emperor Zeno, support for Emperor Nepos in Italia wavers. His detractors once more associate him with the powerful barbarian kingdoms surrounding the empire, and some in particular raise King Euric's proposal to become co-emperor of the West with Julius Nepos.
 
* Support for Nepos remains notable amongst a faction in the Roman Senate, however, who attempt (and fail) to pass a resolution refusing recognition to Odoacer as rex Italiae. They and their supporters take up the call of "no kings in Rome".
 
* Odoacer travels with his army back from Constantinople towards Italia, having successfully married his daughter to an imperial nephew and having been crowned by Emperor Zeno.
 
* On reaching Dalmatia, his army of 1 HI, 2 LI, 1 HC and 1 LC is met by 1 LC of Julius Nepos' forces, who form up in honour guard to receive the new "rex Italiae" and convey him back to Italia.
 
* The journey is uneventful, all the way to the Italian border when suddenly, disaster strikes. Without warning, arrows rain down on Odoacer's forces, catching them off guard. Obscured in the failing autumn light, horns sound and signal hidden formations. Roman horns.
 
* Emerging from prepared positions, the entirety of the army of Emperor Julius Nepos surrounds Odoacer's position. Bearing the banners of the Western Roman Empire, a total of 2 HI, 4 LI, 1 A, 2 LC, and 2 HC outnumber the Herulian and Scirian soldiers more than 2-to-1.
 
* Odoacer rallies his troops, until this moment in high spirits, and attempts to use his cavalry to punch a hole for the royal party to escape, but is closed in by the superior numbers. Buoyed by their superior forces and the prospect of victory, Nepos' army commands the field, destroying Odoacer's cavalry before extracting a surrender. They lose their own light cavalry in the fight, but proclaim victory at the Battle of Tarsatica.
 
* Odoacer and his entourage are taken prisoner, delivered to Emperor Nepos himself, along with 1 HI and 2 LI.
 
* With news of Emperor Nepos' victory filtering into Italia, rebels rise up in support of him in southern Gaul where held by Odoacer.
 
* Friendly provinces in the northeast where troops under Ovida responded to raids earlier in the year also declare support for Nepos.
 
* Protests break out in Rome and Ravenna in support of Emperor Nepos, but are quickly suppressed by Thela and the remaining troops in Italia.
 
### EUROPA ORIENS
 
* The Gepids recruit a new leader, Wastila. They also spend time training their army in new more cohesive tactics, drilling them on how best to fight in larger battles.
 
* Gepid travellers, now being called settlers by locals near Singidunum, bed in for the winter. In the nearby city itself, the garrison adopts a defensive posture watching the Gepids closely, and raises new walls and ditches to protect the city.
 
* 1 LI of Ostrogothic troops crosses over into Gepidia under the command of Moesian leader Athalaric. Apparently searching the area around the old palace of Attila, they appear to return empty handed.
 
* In Moesia itself, the Ostrogoths work on significant economic projects - working on the roads, smithing, and revitalising old Roman infrastructure where possible.
 
* Theodoric Strabo recruits 2 units of archers and 1 light infantry, and erects some basic Roman-style castra forts in Thracia for his troops to occupy.
 
* Strabo also launches a larger raid in force north of the Danube again, sending 1 HI, 2 LI and 1 HA to find the culprits behind the death of their precious envoy. However like Longinus earlier in the year, they come away largely empty handed.
 
* When pressed, some remaining locals mention a gathering of chiefs and a withdrawal of forces northwards away from the border.
 
* Some calls are issued by Moesian Ostrogothic nobles to mend the divide with Theodoric Strabo, given that the Empire has neither punished Strabo nor uplifted the Amal. The view that the Ostrogoths ought to be united again gains some traction - but of course, only one man can be king... right?
 
* 2 new fleets are laid down by the Roman Empire in the east.
 
* Under his personal direction, Emperor Zeno arranges additional training for the Excubitors heavy cavalry in Constantinople, raising them up to a new level of performance above and beyond other heavy cavalry.
 
* Yet despite bodyguards and protectors, some threats will always find their way through. In the early hours of the morning, the slaves of the Imperial household find their master difficult to rouse in the morning. The Emperor cannot be woken. The royal physicians summoned deliver the dreaded news - the Emperor has been poisoned, and lies close to death.
 
* Events overtake Roman Empire rapidly over the next few days. Armatus, named magister militum praesentalis under the usurper Basiliscus but pardoned by Zeno on the restoration, raises forces at Nicea. His son, also named Basiliscus, was confirmed as "caesar" by Zeno. Officially, the junior co-emperor.
 
* Before Armatus can move towards the capital, however, protests grip the city against Zeno - for his barbarian origins, his supposed religious heresy, and more.
 
* In the midst of these protests, troops turn out - but not to restore the peace. Under the command of Flavius Marcianus, they seize the key points of the city, including the Forum. As they reach the Imperial Palace and prepare to take control there too, word reaches them. Emperor Zeno has died.
 
* Marcianus takes the capital and declares himself Emperor, supported by the Senate, by his claim to the Imperial bloodline by his father Anthemius in the west and his maternal grandfather Marcian in the east, and by his claim via his wife, daughter of the late Leo I.
 
* Armatus refuses recognition from Nicaea on behalf of his son Basiliscus. Quietly departing the city, Athenodorus (Zeno's nephew and son-in-law to Odoacer) makes for the eastern provinces.
 
### ASIA
 
* Acting swiftly against the second fall of the Bosporan Kingdom, Emperor Zeno orders his brother Longinus to take the Comitatus Thracias north to liberate the kingdom.
 
* Assembling his force of 1 HI, 1 LI, 1 A, 1 LC, 1 HA at Odessos, Longinus is met by 1 LI, 1 A, 2 LC from the Thracian Ostrogoths under Theodegisclus the Crimean, and 2 HI, 2 LI, 2 A, 2 HA led by Theodoric the Amal himself.
 
* A sizeable force, they embark 4 fleets designated for the purpose and set out across the Black Sea.
 
* Reaching the peninsula, Longinus (perhaps foolhardily) orders an amphibious assault on Chersonesus. Unwilling to be responsible for a failed attack, commander of the fleet Illus agrees to put down the army a little ways from the city.
 
* The decision proves wise as it becomes clear that Illig, the warlord now ruling the peninsula, has expanded his forces to 2 HI, 2 LI, 2 A, and 2 LC.
 
* The battle is bloody, and while Longinus' lack of experience does not weigh heavily upon the Romans with Theodoric's skills in play, it quickly becomes clear that Illig gives truth to the title "warlord", proving himself a strong strategist.
 
* Complicating matters further still, Theodegisclus insists on keeping his forces in reserve, despite the protests of Theodoric and his own officers.
 
* The weight of numbers wins the day for Rome, as Illig's troops withdraw into the city havin suffered the total loss of his cavalry, but having defeated Longinus' own. A close siege is ordered, while Theodegisclus sets about establishing control over the remainder of the peninsula.
 
* As the weeks pass and news of events in Constantinople reach both Illus and Longinus, both quickly reject the prospect of hailing any new emperor as successor to Zeno.
 
* After nearly 6 months of jumping through hoops in failed attempts to see the Roman Emperor, the ambassador for Kartli returns home empty handed.
 
* Dismayed by the lack of reception, King Vakhtang submits to Sassanid pressure and reinstates some (but not all) or the previously dismissed Zoroastrians in his government.
 
* Wishing to show some support to the besieged Christians of the Caucasus, Peter the Fuller, Patriarch of Antioch, leads a mission of his own to minister to the Georgians. He calls on the Emperor to send succour the faithful.
 
* Persia raises 3 new units - 2 A, 1 LI - and garrisons them in restive Armenia.
 
* Settling a treaty with the Guptas, the Sassanids are recognised as rulers of Sindh. Tribute continues to flow in some measure from Sindh to the Gupta court, and both come away with something... although, of course, many amongst the Guptas now look on the Sassanian rule in Sindh as a form of vassalage.
 
* Peroz orders his army to establish control across the remainder of Sindh, supported by his fleets, before largely returning to their garrison in Sakastan. 1 LI, 1 HI, and 1 LC remain.
 
* Coming into contact with the Alchon Huns along their new northeastern border beyond the Indus, Persian concerns are soon fanned by a renewed Alchon expansion to match their own. Adding 5 HI and 1 HC to their forces, they launch a renewed war against the Guptas as they withdraw from Sindh and the border regions, pressing further into the Indian subcontinent.
 
* Further north, the White Huns complete their conquest of the Xiyu city states.
 
* As the Persian fleet returns home to the Gulf from the war in Sindh, they make stops at the Omani ports and offer the protection of the Shah. The traders and city states decline for the time being, relying on the relative peace in southern Arabia... for now.
 
* Meanwhile the naval deployment in Socotra sails up and down the coast near the Himyarites and the Somali city states, attempting to keep the waters free from raiders who would menace shipping. Some awkward encounters are had with Somali and Indian sailors, keen to maintain their own free access to the Red Sea, but for the time being all remains peaceful and the Persian fleet returns to Mesopotamia for the winter.
 
### AFRICA
 
* The Vandals recruit 1 HC and 1 HA, turning to mounted strength to dominate their widespread domains. They also raise another Vandal leader, Gunthamund.
 
* After their most recent clashes with the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, the Vandals assemble their military and under their Berber leader Aedemon send 1 HI, 1 LI, 1 A, and 1 LC across land heading westward for the border.
 
* Word soon travels along the coast with traders and merchants, and the new kingdom braces for an invasion by deploying their forces eastwards to meet Aedemon.
 
* Meanwhile, a grand fleet of 5 units departs from Carthage, secretly sailing westward. News soon arrives that this fleet has landed in the Berber kingdom - apparently at the ruins of Portus Magnus, which the Vandals themselves had destroyed some years before.
 
* Disembarking a large force of 2 HI, 3 LI, 4 A, 1 LC, 2 CC under King Huneric himself, the Vandals make the difficult overland journey to the Berber capital at Altava.
 
* Facing the broadly undefended city, the citizens make an attempt to man the walls themselves before realising the intimidating odds mounted against them. Altava opens its gates to Huneric, who claims a great victory - yet remains deep behind enemy lines with uncertain supply lines.
 
* Perhaps hearing of the events further west, perhaps simply seeking a fight, the Berber army presses onwards against the Vandal blocking force. 3 LI, 3 A, and 3 CC emerge out of the desert and quickly overwhelm the underprepared Vandal forces - destroying them to a man in a crushing victory of the Berbers own.
 
* The Berber king, Masinissa, is hailed by his men as a new Scipio Africanus. Proclaiming that the road to Carthage lies open, his forces march onwards.
 
* Deeper in their territory, the Berber kingdom raises 2 CC and 1 HA.
 
* The Comitatus Aegypti is ordered to deploy guards to protect Christian churches in Alexandria from further violence.
 
* The violence is successfully diverted from the churches, but mobs soon convene on government buildings instead. Incensed by speeches by prominent Neoplatonists and pagan leaders of all stripes, they clash with troops near the barracks and quickly withdraw.
 
* Diverted again, the rioters occupy the Forum. Horapollo, a leader in the Egyptian priesthood and prominent speaker, issues a set of demands: freedom of conscience, government funding to restore the temples of Greco-Roman, Egyptian, and other faiths, protection of those temples, and an end to favourable taxation for the Christians.
 
* Political infighting overtakes the provincial government in Egypt, as court intrigues and differences of approach to the riots paralyse action.
