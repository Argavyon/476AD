## NEWS  
  
### EUROPA OCCIDENS  
  
* Rumours abound in mainland Europe that following a violent campaign against the Romanised Britons, a Saxon named Ã†lle has established a kingdom in the south of Brittia.  
  
* Following the blocked attempt by the Roman general Syagrius to send supplies across Visigothic territory to Rome, envoys flit back and forth across Western Europe. Accusations are levelled, and relations between Roman Gaul and the Visigoths quickly deteriorate as demands for restitution are made.  
  
* Tensions are narrowly prevented from boiling over when a declaration is made by the exiled Emperor Julius Nepos, who proclaims he will send an army to symbolically guard Roman trade caravans from Gaul on their way to Rome.   
  
* The idea is seized upon by numerous other foederati and Roman factions, and quickly becomes a test of virtue and adherence to Roman values in the declining Roman world.  
  
* Beginning in Dalmatia, an army under the banners of the Roman Empire and headed by Julius Nepos himself sets out. 2 HC, 2 HI, 1 A, and 2 LC quickly cross the border into Italy, heading westwards towards Gaul.  
  
* Before long, 2 LC split off from the army and, under the command of General Ovida, head north towards Alemannia. Crossing through the still snow-y passes of the Alps, they launch raids on Alemanni encampments still wintering in Rhaetia and burn their way through several small villages, the punitive expedition apparently an assertion of protection of Romans.  
  
* Continuing to traverse through the heavily forested lands, the ground still lying thick with snow, Ovida soon finds himself confronting a Alemanni cavalry force - 2 light cavalry units against his own matching numbers. The intent clear on both sides, the cavalry forces charge headlong. Outmanoeuvring the Romans in the early stages of the battle, the Alemanni take an early upper hand. However as the clash prolongs, the greater discipline of the Romans and the personal leadership of Ovida make themselves felt. The battle is close, but before long the Alemanni break off, disappearing into the forests from whence they came.   
  
* No significant losses are felt by either side, but Ovida chooses to take advantage of this moment of victory to return with captives to Dalmatia rather than remain in barbarian territory. He hails the battle as a great victory for Rome.  
  
* As word of the raid carries through northeastern Italia with the returning army a train of bound Alemanni prisoners following close behind, population centres raided by the tribes late last year hail "Nepos Imperator" as their protector - Odoacer's own inaction noticeable on the frontier with the barbarians.  
  
* The remainder of Nepos' army continues on and, before long, is caught from behind by a surprising addition - 2 HC units under the command of Marcianus (brother-in-law to Emperor Zeno and from a line of Emperors himself), as well as 1 HI, 2 LI, 1 HA and 1 LC contributed by the Thracian Ostrogoths.  
  
* Close behind come the troops of King Theodoric the Amal, adding 1 LC and 2 HI to the force. These Moesian Ostrogoths keep their distance at first from their Thracian brothers, before intermingling at the urging of Theodoric.  
  
* The army soon reaches Genua where they are joined by 2 HI and 1 LC, Herulian troops under the nominal command of Roman senator Caecina Decius Maximus Basilius. Perhaps signalling a more diplomatic tilt to his own mission, Basilius offers deference to Nepos, officially following the forms and honours due to a Roman Emperor.  
  
* Passing through Massilia near the frontier with the Visigoths, the procession turns northwards towards Vienne in lands now settled by the Burgundians. They are warmly welcomed by King Chilperic, who throws a grand reception for the visitors as a display of Burgundian hospitality and influence. He adds his own 1 LI and 1 LC to the force.  
  
* The 20 unit strong procession - an army, in truth - sets off from Vienne and in short order reaches the border with the Visigothic Kingdom. However as it prepares to cross, riders arrive from Vienne announcing a great tragedy. Gundobad, the most influential and powerful of the Burgundian princes, has been found dead. Murdered.  
  
* Accusations are levelled, in particular at Emperor Zeno (whose father-in-law and predecessor as Emperor had a hand in deposing Glycerius, Gundobad's "puppet" emperor), at Emperor Nepos (who actually removed Glycerius), and at Marcianus (whose father, Emperor Anthemius, was killed by Gundobad). The Burgundian contingent quickly departs the army, returning to Vienne.  
  
* Word reaches the Roman and foederati forces as they cross into Visigothic Gaul that the entire Visigoth army has mobilised - however the majority of it remains at Tolosa under King Euric.  
  
* Within days of crossing the border, a force of 2 HC, 3 LC and 2 HA arrives under Aoric, a Visigothic general. Meeting formally with Emperor Nepos, he is polite and deferential, and indicates his forces will remain at a respectful distance. Invited to attend on King Euric in Tolosa for a grand celebration, the army indicates it intends to proceed directly to Lutetia, without taking such a lengthy detour.  
  
* Rumours begin to spread, rapidly quashed, of hastily abandoned preparations for a banquet toasting Emperor Nepos and King Euric. Unkind questions rapidly circulate, particularly amongst some distant Gothic nobles in Hispania, pondering whether Euric has "embarrassed the dignity of the Visigoths".  
  
* Taking its time along the march, the ponderously large army makes its way at last to Roman Gaul, meeting at the border a force of 1 HC and 1 HA under Syagrius himself. Only regular trade caravans bound for the south are present, but Emperor Nepos announces he has brought his own supplies and aid to Roman Gaul, earning the respect of many nobles there.  
  
* After a short time in the city of Lutetia, the procession sets out southwards, quickly returning back the way it came - though noticeably passing through Burgundian lands without much stopping.  
  
* Passing out of Visigothic lands, King Euric's advisors are pleased to note no clashes between either army. Nevertheless, they note much trouble generally in the lands passed through - be it petty crimes like theft from farmers, to more serious instances of rape and murder in villages and settlements along the way. No perpetrators amongst the Roman and foederati forces can be distinctively pointed to.  
  
* Reaching Italia, the procession diverts south towards Rome itself. Stopping north of the River Rubicon, Emperor Nepos halts the combined army and travels south alone with his bodyguards, guiding the trade caravans to the city.  
  
* With word of his grand gesture and of the raids against the Alemanni having reached Rome, the Emperor is warmly welcomed by crowds back to the city - a sight which some had predicted would never be seen again. With Odoacer not in Italia, there are few to challenge Nepos' return to the Eternal City.  
  
* Despite the disconcert of the remaining Sciri-Heruli troops in Italia, the masses hail Nepos as "Defensor Imperii" - defender of the Empire. A faction well-inclined towards Nepos in the Senate likewise hails his return.  
  
* Yet, Nepos does not remain in Rome for long. Returning to his entourage, he rides north once more and rejoins his forces. Some eager supporters of Nepos form 1 unit of light infantry in his support, and join him as he returns to Dalmatia.  
  
* The remaining forces all likewise begin their journies home, save for the forces under Syagrius, who loiter near the border with the Visigoths and the Burgundians, unsure which is safest to cross.  
  
* In Burgundy itself, Godegisel is raised as a leader in the kingdom in place of his brother, who had been one of the most influential challengers for the throne.  
  
* Likewise seeking to punish the Alemanni for their raids into Italia, 1 LC and 1 LI are sent from Gaul to harry other tribes in the west. Though some chieftains proclaim non-involvement with events further south, they are targeted nonetheless, with one named Suomar seized by Roman forces alongside other captives.  
  
* Unrest spreads across Alemannia, with several chieftains demanding the release of the captives.  
  
* Roman Gaul raises 2 additional heavy infantry, and builds a new fleet in the seas to the north.  
  
* A new official is also raised to assist the governance of Gaul, a Gallo-Roman known as Lupincius.  
  
* Trade envoys disperse across northwestern Europe, going to the Bretons, Angles and Saxons, Franks, Basques, Frisons, and Franks. Most are already trading substantially with Gaul, but the recent presence of a substantial Roman Army - of the kind most had thought would never be seen again - leads most of these neighbouring tribes to regard Roman once more with caution.  
  
* The Franks in particular seem shaken by events, and dramatically increase the numbers of their forces, adding 2 HI, 3 A, and 2 LC to their numbers  
  
* The Visigoths undertake significant internal reforms, creating an protective network designed to keep the King safe from assassination, including food tasters and bodyguards. They additionally recruit 1 HC and 2 HI.  
  
* An envoy to King Hermeneric of the Suebi arrives from Tolosa, proposing cooperation with the Kingdom of the Visigoths and a path forward from the wars of the 450s.  
  
* Odoacer's son, Thela, is raised as a leader in Italia.  
  
* In Italia, the Sciri-Heruli heavy infantry drill intensely, further cementing their loyalty to Odoacer and their effectiveness in combat.  
  
### EUROPA ORIENS  
  
* Two new leaders rise up amongst the Moesian Ostrogoths - Athalaric and Wittaulf, chieftains and war leaders.  
  
* Along with them, 2 HA, 1 LC, and 1 A are recruited and trained, significantly expanding Ostrogothic military power.  
  
* The Moesian Ostrogoths also receive a gift from their Thracian brethren, as Theodoric Strabo seems to continue his attempts to mend the Gothic divide. Concerns grow deeper in Constantinople at this news, with many fearing what might become of a united Ostrogothic force.  
  
* These fears are strengthened still by Strabo's own recruitments, including 2 LI and 1 HI.  
  
* Following an envoy bearing gifts and silks sent to the Goths living on the Crimean peninsula, the Thracian Goths welcome a new leader from their ranks, named Theodegisclus. Further events that transpire in Crimea only serve to deepen Roman concerns.  
  
* The diplomatic outreach does not end there, as the Thracian Goths attempt to build ties with the Rugii, and continue their exploration of Slavic lands. Their envoy to the Rugii is warmly received, but from across the Danube to the north their envoy returns without his head.  
  
* Departing from Ravenna, Odoacer sets out over land towards Constantinople, with an escort of 1 HI, 2 LI, 1 HC, and 1 LC in tow. Amongst his entourage are Epiphanius, the renowned bishop of Pavia, and his own daughter Amalaberge.  
  
* The journey is unproblematic, despite passing through the domains of Julius Nepos and the Thracian Ostrogoths. Upon arriving in Constantinople, the dux Italiae is warmly greeted. Odoacer bends the knee to "the rightful Emperor of the Romans", and is named "rex Italiae" by Emperor Zeno.  
  
* Protests are mounted by many in the Church at this notion, demanding the conversion of Odoacer to Chalcedonian Christianity before he is named king. However when Odoacer demures, the Emperor pursues the matter no further, earning him the further enmity of the Church.  
  
* Further cementing ties between Odoacer and Zeno, the daughter of the new King of Italy is married to Athenodorus, an Isaurian nephew of the Emperor. Celebrations are held in Constantinople and across the eastern half of the Empire to mark the marriage, though they are poorly attended in Constantinople and the surrounding areas, being derided as "a marriage of barbarians to barbarians".  
  
* The ports of the Aegean become a focus of investment, as shipyard and harbours and expanded and improved, increasing capacity for trade.  
  
* Flavius Illus is appointed the new title of magister navium, with command of all military fleets and broad authority over all shipyards, harbours, coastal fortifications, and naval fighting men.  
  
* In recognition of this honour Illus consents to the release of Flavius Longinus, the brother of the Emperor, from his welcome in his home. Illus quickly despatches Longinus north, following in his own footsteps late last year towards the lands of the Sklaveni.  
  
* With 1 unit of light cavalry, Longinus' troops go a step further than Illus and cross the Danube. His troops venture deeper and deeper, but find only abandoned villages and deserted farms - not even Slavic tribes to fight. Withdrawing south, Illus sends Longinus ignominously to Constantinople.  
  
* The Gepids appoint Cunimund, a warrior, as a new leader amongst their people, and raise 1 HI, 1 HC, and 1 HA.  
  
* Shortly afterwards, they follow in the footsteps of the Ostrogoths many years before them and cross south into the Roman Empire, announcing they are merely establishing a base camp ahead of further travels. The garrison at Sigindum bristles, but notes that currently the force is just 1 LI and 1 A, with a great many peasant settlers.  
  
* In Constantinople, the Senate advocates making a deal with the Gepids to avoid further migrations, perhaps paying them greater tribute or naming them a federate kingdom.  
  
### ASIA  
  
* Roman missionaries arrive in the Bosporan Kingdom in Crimea, seeking to spread the Word amongst both the client kingdom there and its Gothic neighbours to the north.  
  
* However, these missionaries quickly find the environment there more hostile than they had imagined. Having apparently been taken in by the Utigurs, a Turkic people, the Crimean Goths are rallied into a new attack on Roman Crimea. Under-defended by local forces, they are rapidly overrun. An Utigur calling himself Illig names himself king.  
  
* King Vakhtang of Kartli sends an envoy to Emperor Zeno, bringing gifts and seeking stronger ties - citing his kingdom's growing Christian class, his own faith, and his desire for greater peace and prosperity in the Caucasus.  
  
* Vakhtang follows this up by announcing the dismissal of all Zoroastrians from his high council, though many remain in the rest of his government.  
  
* Persia continues constructing the Walls of Peroz in Ctesiphon. Having spent a full year on their construction, builders predict that another year's worth of funding will be needed, and that the walls will be completed before 480 AD.  
  
* Bolstering the defence of the capital in the meantime, the Shah orders that 1 CT and 1 HI unit be raised there for now. Separately, 2 HI are recruited in Merv to the east.  
  
* Bolstering their position on the new Socotran colony, the Persians send 1 LI and 1 fleet to protect the small colony and shipping through the region.  
  
* In Arabia, the Lakhmids proclaim themselves King of All the Arabs, exacerbating tensions with their neighbours.  
  
* After celebrating Nowruz, the Persian new year, Shahanshah Peroz announces a tour of the eastern provinces and brings 2 HI, 1 HC, 1E, and 1 CT with him to Sakastan.  
  
* From there, noting the lack of tribute from Sindh, the Sassanid Empire takes the opportunity presented by the decline of the Gupta Empire to solidify its control over Sindh for the first time in a generation.  
  
* Sending a massive total of 3 HI, 3 LI, 1 A, 3 HC, 2 LC, 3 HA, 1 E and 1 CT, Peroz crosses into the weakly held province. From the sea, 2 naval units under Balash sail from the Gulf to simultaneously seize control of the Indus River.  
  
* Gupta control in the region is virtuall nonexistent - yet the Sassanids face some minor opposition from a local satrap, who attempts to resist, mustering only 4 HI, 1 A, and 1 LC. Despite having the advantage of terrain at the banks of the mighty Indus, and having successfully held off Sassanian advances, the Sindhi forces soon fell before the weight of numbers. Although the Persians lost 1 A and 1 LI, their enemies are destroyed to a man in a complete rout.  
  
* The Guptas react extremely negatively, and send an immediate emissary to the Sassanian shah demanding compensation. Notably, however, no military moves are yet witnessed - perhaps as the Sassanids have not yet occupied the full extent of the claimed territory.  
  
* Hephthalites complete their campaign against Shanshan and Kucha, two of the remaining city states of the Tarim Basin. Their losses are light, and the cities acquiesce quickly to White Hun rulership, bringing yet more riches into the semi-nomadic empire.  
  
### AFRICA  
  
* King Gaiseric of the Vandals sets out with 2 units of camel cavalry in a renewed attempt to pacify the heavily Berber-controlled African interior. The aged king soon regrets his ambitions, and although the Berbers fear him enough to retreat in his path, the punishing sun is not as easily cowed. With a matter of days, the mighty Vandal king succumbs to old age, exacerbated by heat exhaustion.  
  
* With the death of the famed king, the intimidating power of the Vandals seems less severe across north Africa. The Berbers further west quickly set about taking advantage of the perceived power vacuum, and establish a Mauro-Roman kingdom in he old Roman provinces of Mauretania.  
  
* Their efforts are interrupted around Septem, the old capital of Mauretania Tingitana, when the new King Huneric arrives with 1 LI and 1 HC to establish a colony.  
  
* Upon arrival Huneric manages to deploy successfully, but soons finds himself opposed by 2 camel cavalry units under a Berber commander. He acquits himself well in the early stages of the battle, but the unfamiliar terrain and some disorganisation from the landing hampers his forces. Luckily the Berbers fare just as poorly, and in the bloody and messy fight, both sides lose a unit each before the Vandals withdraw.  
  
* The Suebi send a bishop to the new Mauro-Roman Kingdom, preaching the creed of Areian Christianity. He is promptly sent away, leaving the small Chalcedonian kingdom firmly wedged between Areian Visigoths to the north and Areian Vandals to the east.  
  
* Perhaps eager to obtain the benefits of Berber desert strength, the Vandals raise a cooperate Berber leader named Aedemon to high government office.  
  
* In response to the riots in Alexandria, Emperor Zeno issues a general pardon and provides funds for the damaged church to be restored. However, the mob Is not so easily appeased, and pagan protests erupt again - this time in a more disparate manner, rather than concentrated - and several churches are ransacked. They demand an end to conversions in the province, and the replacement of the governor.
